# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project curriculum!

It is a simple recipe website built using only **HTML**. Once completed, it will demonstrate my ability to:
- Use basic HTML structure (headings, paragraphs, links, images)
- Create multiple pages and link them together
- Use lists and other common tags

This will help me get comfortable with writing raw HTML and structuring a multi-page site without any CSS or JavaScript yet.
